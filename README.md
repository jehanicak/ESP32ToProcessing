## ESP32 to Processing Assignment
### Jake Hanicak - 4/16/20 - Interaction Design

##### In this assignment I have used the in-class code (from arduino) for the sending data to Processing. FOR this assignment I have three things that can happen by interacting with your ESP32. 
1. You can see a basic screen of red
2. You can press the button and the background changes rapidly and text appears 
3. you can cover the LDR sensor to make shapes appear randomly in random colors
